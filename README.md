# This program has been written in the form of Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (Class).

# This program solves 2D governing equations of heat and mass transfer for three different types of Indirect Evaporative Coolers (IEC).

# Three different types of IECs are called Counter, Cross and Regenerative configuration. 

# This program consists of three folders: 
  * One folder which is named "libs", includes all required classes to solve the problem
  * One folder which is named "solver", includes your main code file ("main.cpp") 
  * Another folder which is named "inputData", includes "coolerData.txt" file to enter required data for solving the problem 

# If you want to run this program, all you need to do is:
  1. Go to "inputData" folder
  2. Open "coolerData.txt" file and enter required data 
  3. Go to "solver" folder
  4. Compile "main.cpp" file and then run
